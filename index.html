<BODY>
<P>Calculators of integrals and derivatives have currently been implemented for the following functions:</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TR>
 <TD><A HREF="power.html?w=2">power functions</A></TD>
 <TD><I>f</I>(<I>x</I>) = <I>c</I>&sdot;<I>x<SUP>n</SUP></I></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD><A HREF="exp.html?w=4&b=e">exponential functions</A></TD>
 <TD><I>f</I>(<I>x</I>) = <I>c</I>&sdot;<I>b<SUP>x</SUP></I></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Graphs are customizable by passing the following configuration settings in the web address bar.  (For example, directing your browser to <A HREF="power.html?l=4">power.html?l=4</A> draws the function with a line stroke of 4 pixels in width, while <A HREF="power.html?l=2">power.html?l=2</A> only draws lines half as thick.)</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" WIDTH="100%">

<TR>
 <TD>l</TD>
 <TD>Thickness of line strokes, in pixels.</TD>
 <TD>1.0</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>r</TD>
 <TD>Scope, range and resolution of coordinate plane projection in raster coordinates.  For rescaling the graph to better suit your monitor resolution and window size.</TD>
 <TD>512</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>w</TD>
 <TD>Coordinate plane window span and width, in vector units.  For adjusting the coverage inside the graph of a wider field of the function's domain and range.</TD>
 <TD>1.0</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>x</TD>
 <TD>Immediately draw the tangent line to the function at the point (<I>x</I>, <I>f</I>(<I>x</I>)).</TD>
 <TD>undefined</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>&hellip;</TD>
 <TD>Any other variables the user would rather set in the URL rather than type into a text box after the page finishes loading, depending on which function type is being graphed with respect to which constant inputs.</TD>
 <TD>varies</TD>
